# Recursive-ABC-Pathfinder
ABC Path is a puzzle where every letter from A to Y must into the grid next to the previous letter either horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Additionally, the letters must be postioned according to the constraints around the edges which specify the row, column or diagonal each letter is in.

This project allows a player to set up a puzzle (or use the preset) and attempt solve it. The project uses recursive backtracking to either verify the players solution, determine the solution to the puzzle, or notify the player if there is no possible solution.

If you want to play more than the preset, daily ABC Path puzzles can be found at [BrainBashers.com](https://www.brainbashers.com/abcpath.asp)
